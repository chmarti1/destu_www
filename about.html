            <b>"When I graduate, I’m going to be a _____. Why should I care about General Education?"</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            Destination Unknown is a project that uses dialogue to explore the impact of a General Education on the complicated, winding careers of real people.           
        </p>
        <p>
            As they take on leadership roles, start their own companies, brave intimidating changes in their career paths (including the prospect of joblessness), or simply make great leaps in the name of their own happiness, they all face the task of translating 120+ credits of a college education into a profession--if not a series of professions--outside anything their dreaming, first-year student-selves would have ever foreseen.  
        </p>
        <p>
            Through conversation, our interlocutors share with us the challenges they have endured, the successes they have celebrated, and the failures they have suffered. They talk about the collage of knowledge they are still curating, and how it helps them with the difficult look in the mirror every time another reinvention is impending, whether by necessity or by choice.   
        </p>
        <p>
            So how does an engineering course help an editor see connections in her writers’ subjects? Technical theater open up a whole new professional path for a doubtful engineer? A psychology course transform an aspiring medical doctor into a counselor with a thriving career (while disappointing his parents)?  
        </p>
        <p>
            How can dance help leaders be aware of the non-verbal cues they give to others? History instill us with the tendency to doubt and the capacity to restore? Math reveal itself in problems and solutions all at the same time? And studying another language build the home you never knew you needed?    
        </p>
        <p>
            Destination Unknown does not seek definitive answers to these questions; neither does it offer career advice or distill the evolving labor market into desirable skillsets. It rather employs dialogue and storytelling to spark conversations about the functions of a General Education across the experiences of a lifetime.          
        </p>
        <p>
            Our speakers are professionals from a wide array of disciplines and inter-disciplines, on straight career paths and newly patterning career mosaics. How do college graduates, 5, 10, 15+ years out, view their General Education courses? What has proven important? What has come as a surprise? And are there any regrets?
        </p>
        <p>
            We find our interlocutors’ thoughts to be as deeply insightful as they are wondrously unpredictable. Our hope is, you do, too.

            As someone who teaches in the General Education curriculum almost every semester, I think about the place these courses hold in a student’s academic career quite a bit.  
        </p>
        <p>
            Institutional “learning outcomes” provide some guidance, but they cannot convey why a word in another language, studied in college, feels right for a tattoo years later, or in what ways asking the best questions in the room can be career-defining (and foundational in life, too).          
        </p>
        <p>
            Listening to the inaugural Destination Unknown panelists reflect on General Education, and education generally, was revelatory in this regard. Unmoored from the strictures of “the bio,” our speakers drifted with the twists and turns of their life stories, describing lessons hard-earned on the ground but also how to keep a lively practice of the impossible. They talked about following a single pencil line into a profession, defending an inclination against laughter, and thinking about professional life in images decidedly not “the path.”   
        </p>
        <p>
            No employer survey could have rivaled their fantastical clarity. Their stories have already changed how I talk about GenEd in my classes. We need many more of them.
