1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:24,500


2
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,270
What the job market
looks like today

3
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:29,120
versus what it's going to look
like and four years, when folks

4
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:32,840
graduate, it's constantly
evolving, constantly changing.

5
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,850
Today most people
graduating are going

6
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:37,470
to have many jobs
throughout their lives.

7
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:44,930
And so I think success is much
less about having the content

8
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:48,023
knowledge or
certainly, of course,

9
00:00:48,023 --> 00:00:49,940
there's always some
technical skills you need,

10
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:52,190
but it's really
about the ability

11
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:55,430
to be flexible and adapt and
to come into a new workplace

12
00:00:55,430 --> 00:01:01,520
and how have the
confidence and the ability

13
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,970
to get up to speed quickly,
to work well with a team,

14
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:09,260
to apply some basic
toolset of sort

15
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:12,620
of quantitative and
qualitative analysis

16
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:16,940
to many different
topics and issues,

17
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:19,400
regardless of where you end up.

18
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:29,620


19
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:32,620
The thing from my
graduate school education

20
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:34,180
that was the most
valuable was we

21
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:37,300
had to do a semester
long group project.

22
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:43,180
And that very closely mimicked
what my day to day life

23
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:46,120
was like working
for this consulting

24
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:48,730
firm for the last nine years.

25
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:53,800
You had people with very
different work styles.

26
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:59,770
It's very easy to think that
everybody works the same way

27
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:02,740
that you do, that everyone
thinks the same way that you

28
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:06,430
do, that everyone communicates
the same way that you do.

29
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:10,810
But that's not true
obviously, and learning

30
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:15,070
how to work with people
who think and work

31
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:20,290
and communicate differently
than you is undeniably

32
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:24,910
one of the most important keys
to success in the workplace

33
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:27,730
today, no matter
what field you're in.

34
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:31,420
And the group projects force
you to learn how to do that.

35
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:41,680


36
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,890
In my field, collaboration
is really essential

37
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:49,360
because every article I
work on involves a writer.

38
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,400
Sometimes the writer has
a research assistant,

39
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,440
and I'm there as an editor.

40
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,620
I have a top editor who looks
at it after I do sometimes two

41
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:57,340
of them.

42
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:59,680
We have design people,
we have copy editors,

43
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,840
we have fact checkers,
and everyone's

44
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,760
going to change the
piece a little bit,

45
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:04,760
including the designers.

46
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:07,012
Sometimes the designers
will find a piece of art

47
00:03:07,012 --> 00:03:09,220
or do a portrait that makes
me want the story to have

48
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:11,428
an element it didn't have
before just because of what

49
00:03:11,428 --> 00:03:12,980
they did visually.

50
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:15,640
So I think the key
thing to realize

51
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,610
is that the end
result is never going

52
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:19,360
to be exactly what any
one of those people

53
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,840
would have done if they'd been
sitting in a room by themselves

54
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,872
and that that's often
the goal is that it's

55
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:27,580
better than what the
person would come up

56
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:28,372
with by themselves.

57
00:03:28,372 --> 00:03:30,127
But even if there
are ways where you

58
00:03:30,127 --> 00:03:32,710
feel a little pinch as a writer,
as an editor, that you didn't

59
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:34,377
exactly get what you
wanted, but there's

60
00:03:34,377 --> 00:03:37,210
something really beautiful about
the collective energy of it

61
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:39,160
that kind of supersedes that.

62
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,230
We all have the ability.

63
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:43,310
If I wanted to go self-publish
a book, I could do that.

64
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:45,430
I don't know how
well it would sell.

65
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:49,540
I think, more often
than not, that dialectic

66
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:53,980
of going back and forth
with a thesis, antithesis,

67
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:57,430
synthesis-- so I have an idea,
my boss has a different idea,

68
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:59,370
we have a phone
conversation, and I say, aha,

69
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:00,620
I get what you're saying here.

70
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:02,500
Let's do the third thing.

71
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,050
It sharpens it and sharpens
it and sharpens it,

72
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:06,970
and that's why we have editors.

73
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:08,530
That's the reason for it.

74
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:10,240
People also have
layers of distance

75
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,948
from the piece that
give them perspective

76
00:04:11,948 --> 00:04:14,490
that you wouldn't have if you've
been living and breathing it

77
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:15,670
night and day.

78
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:20,649
So in the end I think, just
as in a lot of areas in life,

79
00:04:20,649 --> 00:04:23,170
it's a constant conversation
between what we could control

80
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:24,940
and what we can't
control, and then

81
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:26,635
what comes out of that is life.

82
00:04:26,635 --> 00:04:38,360


83
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:41,140
People who are
strategic thinkers

84
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:47,320
don't just accept what
they're told necessarily.

85
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:52,000
I think all of our fields
are constantly evolving,

86
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,710
and the way that we're taught
how to do things or the way

87
00:04:56,710 --> 00:05:03,370
that we're taught that
the world is evolves.

88
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:06,100
And so in our
work, it was really

89
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:10,570
important to have people
who would regularly

90
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:17,530
question those things and bring
new and different perspectives

91
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:20,710
to the conversation.

92
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:23,540
Every project that
we did was different.

93
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:27,110
We did not follow a
template in our work.

94
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:30,640
So we had hundreds of
clients over the years,

95
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:33,400
and each time we sat
down with the client,

96
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:38,410
and we understood their problem,
and we designed a process that

97
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:41,500
was going to help them
get to the solution

98
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:45,730
that they were looking for,
that was unique to that client.

99
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:48,670
Because the context
of the culture

100
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:51,130
and the politics
and the people is

101
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:53,840
different in every situation.

102
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:59,950
And so folks who would not be
considered strategic thinkers

103
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:03,250
would just say, OK well
how did we do that before?

104
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:06,440
Let's just apply that
same thing over again.

105
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:09,100
But what we were really
trying to get to was like,

106
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:11,410
OK, it's important to
think about what worked

107
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:14,140
and what didn't work about how
we've done things in the past,

108
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:18,340
and then adapt that to meet the
unique needs of this situation.

109
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:21,190


110
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:24,240
And I think that
is a skill, again,

111
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:28,710
that is essential probably no
matter what field you're in,

112
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:32,430
because again, the world
is evolving so quickly.

113
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:34,125
We can't just accept
the way that things

114
00:06:34,125 --> 00:06:35,250
have been done in the past.

115
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:44,710


116
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:47,210
In my field, and I think in a
lot of fields, what people are

117
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:49,700
looking for is the ability
to see the big picture

118
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:52,050
and focus really
sharply on details.

119
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:54,602
And sometimes people are too
much of one or the other.

120
00:06:54,602 --> 00:06:56,060
They have good big
picture thinking

121
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:57,200
but they can't zero in.

122
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,520
Or sometimes they're
very detail oriented,

123
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,240
but they lose sight
of the big picture.

124
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,840
So I think part of
what I was referring

125
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:06,050
to when I talked about
agility is that ability

126
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:09,170
to go back and forth between
seeing the big topic,

127
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:12,300
and then focusing in on
all the different areas.

128
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:14,780
And so when we get cover
letters, and we get resumes,

129
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:16,310
we're looking for
specific skills.

130
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:18,860
I work at a magazine that
focuses on science and history

131
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:21,732
mostly, so we're looking to
see like, oh, interesting,

132
00:07:21,732 --> 00:07:22,940
they have a minor in history.

133
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:25,910
Or look at that, they
also study physics.

134
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:28,950
So we're looking for areas where
they could be helpful to us.

135
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:31,770
But we're also
looking at curiosity,

136
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:33,020
as one of the students put it.

137
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:34,970
That's just whether they
have the kind of mind

138
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:37,760
that just wants to learn
and uncover things.

139
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,780
That's such an important
skill for so many jobs,

140
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:42,220
and certainly my line of work.

141
00:07:42,220 --> 00:08:34,432
