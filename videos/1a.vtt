00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.270 align:middle line:84%
What the job market
looks like today

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:29.120 align:middle line:84%
versus what it's going to look
like and four years, when folks

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:32.840 align:middle line:84%
graduate, it's constantly
evolving, constantly changing.

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.850 align:middle line:84%
Today most people
graduating are going

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:37.470 align:middle line:84%
to have many jobs
throughout their lives.

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:44.930 align:middle line:84%
And so I think success is much
less about having the content

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:48.023 align:middle line:84%
knowledge or
certainly, of course,

00:00:48.023 --> 00:00:49.940 align:middle line:84%
there's always some
technical skills you need,

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.190 align:middle line:84%
but it's really
about the ability

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.430 align:middle line:84%
to be flexible and adapt and
to come into a new workplace

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:01.520 align:middle line:84%
and how have the
confidence and the ability

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.970 align:middle line:84%
to get up to speed quickly,
to work well with a team,

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:09.260 align:middle line:84%
to apply some basic
toolset of sort

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.620 align:middle line:84%
of quantitative and
qualitative analysis

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:16.940 align:middle line:84%
to many different
topics and issues,

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:19.400 align:middle line:90%
regardless of where you end up.

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:32.620 align:middle line:84%
The thing from my
graduate school education

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:34.180 align:middle line:84%
that was the most
valuable was we

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.300 align:middle line:84%
had to do a semester
long group project.

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:43.180 align:middle line:84%
And that very closely mimicked
what my day to day life

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:46.120 align:middle line:84%
was like working
for this consulting

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.730 align:middle line:90%
firm for the last nine years.

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:53.800 align:middle line:84%
You had people with very
different work styles.

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:59.770 align:middle line:84%
It's very easy to think that
everybody works the same way

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:02.740 align:middle line:84%
that you do, that everyone
thinks the same way that you

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:06.430 align:middle line:84%
do, that everyone communicates
the same way that you do.

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:10.810 align:middle line:84%
But that's not true
obviously, and learning

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.070 align:middle line:84%
how to work with people
who think and work

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:20.290 align:middle line:84%
and communicate differently
than you is undeniably

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.910 align:middle line:84%
one of the most important keys
to success in the workplace

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:27.730 align:middle line:84%
today, no matter
what field you're in.

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.420 align:middle line:84%
And the group projects force
you to learn how to do that.

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.890 align:middle line:84%
In my field, collaboration
is really essential

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:49.360 align:middle line:84%
because every article I
work on involves a writer.

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.400 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes the writer has
a research assistant,

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.440 align:middle line:90%
and I'm there as an editor.

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.620 align:middle line:84%
I have a top editor who looks
at it after I do sometimes two

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:57.340 align:middle line:90%
of them.

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.680 align:middle line:84%
We have design people,
we have copy editors,

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.840 align:middle line:84%
we have fact checkers,
and everyone's

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.760 align:middle line:84%
going to change the
piece a little bit,

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:04.760 align:middle line:90%
including the designers.

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.012 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes the designers
will find a piece of art

00:03:07.012 --> 00:03:09.220 align:middle line:84%
or do a portrait that makes
me want the story to have

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.428 align:middle line:84%
an element it didn't have
before just because of what

00:03:11.428 --> 00:03:12.980 align:middle line:90%
they did visually.

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:15.640 align:middle line:84%
So I think the key
thing to realize

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.610 align:middle line:84%
is that the end
result is never going

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:19.360 align:middle line:84%
to be exactly what any
one of those people

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.840 align:middle line:84%
would have done if they'd been
sitting in a room by themselves

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.872 align:middle line:84%
and that that's often
the goal is that it's

00:03:25.872 --> 00:03:27.580 align:middle line:84%
better than what the
person would come up

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:28.372 align:middle line:90%
with by themselves.

00:03:28.372 --> 00:03:30.127 align:middle line:84%
But even if there
are ways where you

00:03:30.127 --> 00:03:32.710 align:middle line:84%
feel a little pinch as a writer,
as an editor, that you didn't

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:34.377 align:middle line:84%
exactly get what you
wanted, but there's

00:03:34.377 --> 00:03:37.210 align:middle line:84%
something really beautiful about
the collective energy of it

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:39.160 align:middle line:90%
that kind of supersedes that.

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:40.230 align:middle line:90%
We all have the ability.

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:43.310 align:middle line:84%
If I wanted to go self-publish
a book, I could do that.

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:45.430 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how
well it would sell.

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:49.540 align:middle line:84%
I think, more often
than not, that dialectic

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:53.980 align:middle line:84%
of going back and forth
with a thesis, antithesis,

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:57.430 align:middle line:84%
synthesis-- so I have an idea,
my boss has a different idea,

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:59.370 align:middle line:84%
we have a phone
conversation, and I say, aha,

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:00.620 align:middle line:90%
I get what you're saying here.

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:02.500 align:middle line:90%
Let's do the third thing.

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.050 align:middle line:84%
It sharpens it and sharpens
it and sharpens it,

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:06.970 align:middle line:90%
and that's why we have editors.

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:08.530 align:middle line:90%
That's the reason for it.

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:10.240 align:middle line:84%
People also have
layers of distance

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:11.948 align:middle line:84%
from the piece that
give them perspective

00:04:11.948 --> 00:04:14.490 align:middle line:84%
that you wouldn't have if you've
been living and breathing it

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:15.670 align:middle line:90%
night and day.

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:20.649 align:middle line:84%
So in the end I think, just
as in a lot of areas in life,

00:04:20.649 --> 00:04:23.170 align:middle line:84%
it's a constant conversation
between what we could control

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:24.940 align:middle line:84%
and what we can't
control, and then

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:26.635 align:middle line:90%
what comes out of that is life.

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.140 align:middle line:84%
People who are
strategic thinkers

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:47.320 align:middle line:84%
don't just accept what
they're told necessarily.

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:52.000 align:middle line:84%
I think all of our fields
are constantly evolving,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.710 align:middle line:84%
and the way that we're taught
how to do things or the way

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:03.370 align:middle line:84%
that we're taught that
the world is evolves.

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:06.100 align:middle line:84%
And so in our
work, it was really

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:10.570 align:middle line:84%
important to have people
who would regularly

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:17.530 align:middle line:84%
question those things and bring
new and different perspectives

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:20.710 align:middle line:90%
to the conversation.

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:23.540 align:middle line:84%
Every project that
we did was different.

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:27.110 align:middle line:84%
We did not follow a
template in our work.

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:30.640 align:middle line:84%
So we had hundreds of
clients over the years,

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:33.400 align:middle line:84%
and each time we sat
down with the client,

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:38.410 align:middle line:84%
and we understood their problem,
and we designed a process that

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:41.500 align:middle line:84%
was going to help them
get to the solution

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:45.730 align:middle line:84%
that they were looking for,
that was unique to that client.

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:48.670 align:middle line:84%
Because the context
of the culture

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:51.130 align:middle line:84%
and the politics
and the people is

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:53.840 align:middle line:90%
different in every situation.

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:59.950 align:middle line:84%
And so folks who would not be
considered strategic thinkers

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:03.250 align:middle line:84%
would just say, OK well
how did we do that before?

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:06.440 align:middle line:84%
Let's just apply that
same thing over again.

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:09.100 align:middle line:84%
But what we were really
trying to get to was like,

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:11.410 align:middle line:84%
OK, it's important to
think about what worked

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:14.140 align:middle line:84%
and what didn't work about how
we've done things in the past,

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:18.340 align:middle line:84%
and then adapt that to meet the
unique needs of this situation.

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:24.240 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
is a skill, again,

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:28.710 align:middle line:84%
that is essential probably no
matter what field you're in,

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:32.430 align:middle line:84%
because again, the world
is evolving so quickly.

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:34.125 align:middle line:84%
We can't just accept
the way that things

00:06:34.125 --> 00:06:35.250 align:middle line:90%
have been done in the past.

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:47.210 align:middle line:84%
In my field, and I think in a
lot of fields, what people are

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:49.700 align:middle line:84%
looking for is the ability
to see the big picture

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:52.050 align:middle line:84%
and focus really
sharply on details.

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:54.602 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes people are too
much of one or the other.

00:06:54.602 --> 00:06:56.060 align:middle line:84%
They have good big
picture thinking

00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:57.200 align:middle line:90%
but they can't zero in.

00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:58.520 align:middle line:84%
Or sometimes they're
very detail oriented,

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:00.240 align:middle line:84%
but they lose sight
of the big picture.

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:02.840 align:middle line:84%
So I think part of
what I was referring

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:06.050 align:middle line:84%
to when I talked about
agility is that ability

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:09.170 align:middle line:84%
to go back and forth between
seeing the big topic,

00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:12.300 align:middle line:84%
and then focusing in on
all the different areas.

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:14.780 align:middle line:84%
And so when we get cover
letters, and we get resumes,

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:16.310 align:middle line:84%
we're looking for
specific skills.

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:18.860 align:middle line:84%
I work at a magazine that
focuses on science and history

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:21.732 align:middle line:84%
mostly, so we're looking to
see like, oh, interesting,

00:07:21.732 --> 00:07:22.940 align:middle line:90%
they have a minor in history.

00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:25.910 align:middle line:84%
Or look at that, they
also study physics.

00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:28.950 align:middle line:84%
So we're looking for areas where
they could be helpful to us.

00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:31.770 align:middle line:84%
But we're also
looking at curiosity,

00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:33.020 align:middle line:90%
as one of the students put it.

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:34.970 align:middle line:84%
That's just whether they
have the kind of mind

00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:37.760 align:middle line:84%
that just wants to learn
and uncover things.

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:39.780 align:middle line:84%
That's such an important
skill for so many jobs,

00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:42.220 align:middle line:90%
and certainly my line of work.
