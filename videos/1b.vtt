00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.550 align:middle line:84%
I think the only thing that
helped me make difficult

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.440 align:middle line:84%
decisions was continuing to
be put in difficult situations

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:37.170 align:middle line:84%
It's realizing, OK, I really
don't like my life right now,

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.870 align:middle line:90%
I'm really unhappy.

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.970 align:middle line:84%
No one is going to
change it for me but me.

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:44.040 align:middle line:84%
So I need to either get
up and do something,

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.420 align:middle line:84%
or I'm going to stay like
this for the rest of my life.

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.048 align:middle line:84%
And it's doing that
time and time again,

00:00:50.048 --> 00:00:51.840 align:middle line:84%
that's the only thing
that makes it easier.

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.420 align:middle line:84%
It's just, you've got
to keep getting up.

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.896 align:middle line:90%
You can't just stay miserable.

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.250 align:middle line:84%
After my first semester
stage managing,

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.590 align:middle line:84%
I did realize that it was
a thing that I enjoyed

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.080 align:middle line:90%
and that I really did--

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:19.300 align:middle line:84%
I did like being in
charge or the person that

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.300 align:middle line:84%
organizes everything and
make sure that things happen.

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.770 align:middle line:84%
And I like being
in control, so it

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:31.250 align:middle line:84%
was a very fitting role
for me, because I like

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:33.380 align:middle line:90%
to think I'm fairly good at it.

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:34.695 align:middle line:90%
So it just worked.

00:01:34.695 --> 00:01:36.320 align:middle line:84%
It was just like,
I'm already organized

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.550 align:middle line:84%
and I'm already
on top of things.

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:42.250 align:middle line:90%
So it just came naturally.

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.530 align:middle line:84%
It really didn't take
any effort for me

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:45.820 align:middle line:90%
to become a stage manager.

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:49.180 align:middle line:84%
It was just like all natural
traits that I already had,

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:51.040 align:middle line:90%
and they just flourished.

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.030 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I realized,
Oh, hey, I have these traits.

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.600 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I thought I did, but
like no, you actually do,

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:58.600 align:middle line:90%
because you're doing it.

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.767 align:middle line:84%
And now people are telling
you you're doing it well.

00:02:00.767 --> 00:02:02.920 align:middle line:84%
So you actually do
have the traits.

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:03.970 align:middle line:90%
You're using them well.

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:08.350 align:middle line:90%
So that was when I realized--

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:10.630 align:middle line:84%
I think that was
actually a really big

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:13.900 align:middle line:84%
self-identifying
point in my life too.

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:20.130 align:middle line:84%
Because it did make me realize,
you're capable of a lot.

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.880 align:middle line:84%
If you can take a semester's
worth of engineering classes

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.080 align:middle line:84%
and also keep track of
college student actors,

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.810 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I think you're
doing all right.

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.910 align:middle line:84%
Even though difficult
things happen,

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:49.680 align:middle line:84%
and things get uncomfortable,
and you're not sure what to do.

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.680 align:middle line:84%
When you become uncertain,
or you become scared,

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.650 align:middle line:84%
or you become just a mess
maybe, in some cases.

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.972 align:middle line:84%
It's just a matter
of doing it anyways.

00:03:01.972 --> 00:03:03.430 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter
if you're scared,

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.210 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't matter if you have
doubts, you have to just do it.

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:08.200 align:middle line:90%
Go for it.

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.290 align:middle line:84%
Because if you don't,
then you'll never know.

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:19.280 align:middle line:90%
You can't let fear stop you.

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.540 align:middle line:84%
Every day, fear has the
opportunity to stop you,

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:24.920 align:middle line:90%
but you just have to keep going.

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:26.290 align:middle line:90%
You have to do things scared.

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:29.330 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't matter if you're
scared or not, just do it.

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.990 align:middle line:90%
Just do it.

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.350 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think for those
of us, many of us who

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:43.027 align:middle line:84%
have lost years in our 20s,
they can be a little scary

00:03:43.027 --> 00:03:43.860 align:middle line:90%
while we're in them.

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:47.140 align:middle line:84%
But then we look back later
and we're so grateful for them.

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:48.840 align:middle line:84%
And I think one
thing that's valuable

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.270 align:middle line:84%
is to think of what made
them orienting years?

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:53.010 align:middle line:84%
As you said, what
made them years

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:55.803 align:middle line:84%
where we actually learn
something about ourselves

00:03:55.803 --> 00:03:56.970 align:middle line:90%
and got on to a better path?

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:58.470 align:middle line:84%
Because I certainly
have friends who

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:01.260 align:middle line:84%
maybe did that for a little
too long and then got

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.120 align:middle line:84%
into their late
30s and early 40s

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:08.310 align:middle line:84%
and still hadn't caught the
train they're waiting for.

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:12.210 align:middle line:84%
| think one thing is
limiting those years.

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:14.095 align:middle line:84%
So if you spend a
year doing something,

00:04:14.095 --> 00:04:16.470 align:middle line:84%
and you've gained something
but it's not really the track

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:17.762 align:middle line:90%
you want to be on, that's fine.

00:04:17.762 --> 00:04:20.579 align:middle line:84%
But you don't want to make
it 5 or 10 years of that.

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:23.820 align:middle line:84%
So that's one
principle I would say.

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:27.720 align:middle line:84%
Another principle is,
once it's been six months

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.430 align:middle line:84%
or you're stopping
and I'm thinking, OK,

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:30.360 align:middle line:90%
what have I gained from this?

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:31.610 align:middle line:90%
What have I learned from this?

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:35.080 align:middle line:84%
And if I don't want to
continue in this direction,

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:39.180 align:middle line:84%
how can I build on those skills
and those things that I enjoy?

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:41.490 align:middle line:84%
For me, for example, I
taught school for a year.

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:44.010 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't want to be a
school teacher in the end,

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:48.600 align:middle line:84%
but I really enjoyed helping
the students edit their papers

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.280 align:middle line:90%
and come up with ideas.

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:53.308 align:middle line:84%
And they realized that I
wanted to be an editor, got me

00:04:53.308 --> 00:04:54.600 align:middle line:90%
that much closer to what I did.

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:55.767 align:middle line:90%
Ultimately, end up doing it.

00:04:55.767 --> 00:04:58.120 align:middle line:84%
And working with people
it was really delightful.

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:01.478 align:middle line:84%
So I think that's
really valuable.

00:05:01.478 --> 00:05:04.020 align:middle line:84%
I think it's just like, I don't
know a lot about agriculture,

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:07.050 align:middle line:84%
but my understanding
is that it helps

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:09.660 align:middle line:84%
to let the fields go
fallow every so often,

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:12.210 align:middle line:84%
or to plant different crops
to rotate crops through.

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:13.710 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's
the same with life.

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:16.085 align:middle line:84%
I think even when you've been
in your career for a while,

00:05:16.085 --> 00:05:17.890 align:middle line:84%
it helps to bring in
some fresh energy.

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:20.497 align:middle line:84%
So if you can really
harvest that in those years.

00:05:20.497 --> 00:05:22.080 align:middle line:84%
Say, you spend a
year and go to Europe

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:22.860 align:middle line:90%
and do something different.

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:24.420 align:middle line:84%
If you're harvesting
fresh energy

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:26.160 align:middle line:84%
that you can then
bring back, that

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:27.840 align:middle line:84%
makes that not
actually a lost year.

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:29.850 align:middle line:90%
It makes it a found year.

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:32.040 align:middle line:84%
And much more fruitful
than if you just

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:34.697 align:middle line:84%
kept your nose to the grindstone
and stayed in the same line

00:05:34.697 --> 00:05:35.280 align:middle line:90%
you'd been in.

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:45.770 align:middle line:84%
So my undergraduate
education really

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:48.405 align:middle line:84%
did focus on all
different disciplines.

00:05:48.405 --> 00:05:50.030 align:middle line:84%
The first year program
really made sure

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:52.760 align:middle line:84%
that students had a handle
on the basics of art,

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:54.830 align:middle line:84%
and electronic
engineering, and physics.

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:58.322 align:middle line:84%
And for me, that really
helped me think broadly.

00:05:58.322 --> 00:05:59.780 align:middle line:84%
I'm a journalist
and I'm an editor,

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:02.030 align:middle line:84%
so actually in a
very literal sense,

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:04.140 align:middle line:84%
these are all areas
I touch on here

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:06.470 align:middle line:90%
and there throughout my work.

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:09.333 align:middle line:84%
But I think even in
more narrow fields,

00:06:09.333 --> 00:06:11.750 align:middle line:84%
you think about great thinkers
like Einstein, for example,

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:12.980 align:middle line:90%
and how he played the violin.

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:15.020 align:middle line:84%
Or you hear stories
about Nikola Tesla,

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:17.900 align:middle line:84%
and I remember hearing in my
electronic engineering class

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:20.708 align:middle line:84%
that he was on a walk reciting
poetry when he suddenly

00:06:20.708 --> 00:06:22.250 align:middle line:84%
had a vision for
something that would

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:24.740 align:middle line:84%
become his main breakthrough
for engineering.

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:29.120 align:middle line:84%
And I think, when you get too
stuck in one rut of thinking,

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:31.892 align:middle line:84%
you don't have those creative
outside the box ideas.

00:06:31.892 --> 00:06:33.350 align:middle line:84%
And so I think
general education is

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:35.017 align:middle line:84%
really important for
teaching your brain

00:06:35.017 --> 00:06:38.000 align:middle line:84%
to function in all different
ways that can wake you up

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.390 align:middle line:90%
when you least expect it.
