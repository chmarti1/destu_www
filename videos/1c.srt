1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,710


2
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:22,650
I think the other thing
that I would recommend

3
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:25,990
is, again, based on what I
didn't do but in retrospect

4
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:31,140
I wish I had, which
was to take more intro

5
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:34,380
classes in different
subjects, and to explore

6
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:37,440
different potential
career pathways.

7
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:42,660
I came into college as an
environmental studies major,

8
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:44,790
and it worked out well for me.

9
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:48,600
It worked out great for
me, and I loved what I did.

10
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,090
But I didn't even consider
that there were other things

11
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:55,380
out there, and I wish I would
have taken intro to psychology,

12
00:00:55,380 --> 00:01:00,460
and some sort of intro to law,
or some more science classes.

13
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:04,209


14
00:01:04,209 --> 00:01:06,278
But for taking
those intro classes,

15
00:01:06,278 --> 00:01:08,320
how do you know if that's
something that's really

16
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,670
going to spark your interest?

17
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:12,370
So I would really
recommend using

18
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:16,270
those four years to explore
different career pathways.

19
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:17,980
Because again, it's
not going to be

20
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:19,823
a waste if you take an
intro to psych class

21
00:01:19,823 --> 00:01:20,740
and you don't like it.

22
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:25,840
You are still going to get
valuable tools and skills

23
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,570
from that, undoubtedly.

24
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:34,990


25
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:37,460
I don't know if I've
mentioned this before,

26
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:42,790
but I remember when I was
in college studying science,

27
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:46,570
but we were required
to also take

28
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:50,950
certain classes like
the counseling, that

29
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:52,960
is, introduction to counseling.

30
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:57,850
And then I was told to study
educational psychology,

31
00:01:57,850 --> 00:01:59,740
and then philosophy.

32
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:02,590
We also had to take that.

33
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:05,710
In fact, those days, us as
science students had questions

34
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:08,139
like, what do I
need philosophy for?

35
00:02:08,139 --> 00:02:10,479
What do I need counseling for?

36
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:13,930
That's not what I'm going to do.

37
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:19,030
But now, looking back, even
though I thought they were not

38
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:21,160
helpful, looking
back-- in fact, I

39
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:25,480
will say that I'm
actually relying heavily

40
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:28,750
on some of these classes that
I thought were not useful.

41
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:36,200


42
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:40,430
One major regret
that I had was, when

43
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:44,090
I was in high school my music
teacher had always said,

44
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:52,230
Solomon, you had a very
excellent music integration.

45
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:53,910
We used to laugh at each other.

46
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:57,750
People would laugh at me
because I was studying music,

47
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:00,270
and so I stopped.

48
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:03,090
And I regret up to now.

49
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:09,460
Because if I had done it,
even as part of my business,

50
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:13,810
I would have used it a lot in
my current counseling practice.

51
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:18,250
But if I had done it, even
when I came to America,

52
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:23,680
it would have been easier for
me because the church I went to,

53
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,250
they needed someone to
play the keyboard for them.

54
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:30,800
And I was so good at it,
I just loved everything.

55
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:34,870
So as a young student
in the colleges,

56
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:43,070
I will encourage all of them, I
would just encourage them that,

57
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:45,070
give yourself that opportunity.

58
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:46,330
Be open.

59
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:49,960
As I said earlier, be
fluid in you're learning,

60
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:53,740
and then study other
areas that you might think

61
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:55,280
that you have no interest.

62
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:59,290
And at the end of the day, it
would be very useful to you.

63
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:01,495
That is one thing
I will recommend

64
00:04:01,495 --> 00:04:05,410
or I would suggest
to college students.

65
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:13,140


66
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:17,670
Explore everything, do
everything, try everything.

67
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:20,010
Even if you're scared to
try it, try it anyways.

68
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:22,260
Even if you don't think
you're going to be good at it,

69
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:23,640
do it anyways.

70
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:27,570
Even if you think it's probably
going to not be so fun,

71
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:29,460
give it a shot anyways.

72
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:31,200
You're not losing
anything, you're not

73
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:40,120
missing out on anything,
you're just giving things a try

74
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:44,320
Why do you think that giving
it a try is important?

75
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,090
Because if you don't
try, you'll never

76
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:47,890
know what could have been.

77
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:51,490


78
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:53,093
You just have to try.

79
00:04:53,093 --> 00:04:54,010
That's the first step.

80
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:55,885
That's literally the
first step, is to try.

81
00:04:55,885 --> 00:05:01,038


82
00:05:01,038 --> 00:05:02,455
Without trying,
there's no motion.

83
00:05:02,455 --> 00:05:11,790


84
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:13,800
I think a career is a quest.

85
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,400
I think life is a quest.

86
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,400
And a career ends up being
a very important part

87
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,960
of how you spend
your time and energy

88
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,460
and what you
contribute to the world

89
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:21,900
and what you gain
from the world.

90
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,532
I do think, though,
that there are so

91
00:05:23,532 --> 00:05:24,990
many different
things you could do,

92
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:26,910
so you should
never feel that you

93
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:32,082
have one chance to get that
gold goblet or whatever it is.

94
00:05:32,082 --> 00:05:33,540
As if the end of
the quest, the pot

95
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:34,810
of gold at the end
of the rainbow.

96
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:35,910
There are a lot of
rainbows and a lot

97
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:37,200
of directions you could go.

98
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:40,890
But since time is limited,
certain point once you've

99
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:42,985
looked around a
bit and explored,

100
00:05:42,985 --> 00:05:45,360
you want to start thinking
one step in front of the other

101
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,790
and leading yourself
towards somewhere.

102
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:51,420
And I would just say,
never feel limited,

103
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:55,410
always look for clues that
show you what you enjoy.

104
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:56,650
Build relationships.

105
00:05:56,650 --> 00:06:01,200
Make sure that you're listening
to people as well as speaking.

106
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,540
And ask lots of
questions, people

107
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:04,993
love being asked questions.

108
00:06:04,993 --> 00:06:07,410
Makes them feel special like
they actually know something.

109
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:10,905
So never hesitate to reach out
to someone even if it seems

110
00:06:10,905 --> 00:06:12,780
like a long shot just
to come to their office

111
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:17,130
and talk to them even if
there's not a job available.

112
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:22,710
And just be a person
who is excited to be

113
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:23,460
part of something.

114
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:24,918
Who's excited to
be part of a team,

115
00:06:24,918 --> 00:06:26,890
who's curious about everything.

116
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:29,010
And I think if you
approach life that way,

117
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:31,460
you'll find what
you're looking for.

118
00:06:31,460 --> 00:07:57,355
