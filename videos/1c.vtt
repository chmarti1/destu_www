00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.650 align:middle line:84%
I think the other thing
that I would recommend

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.990 align:middle line:84%
is, again, based on what I
didn't do but in retrospect

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:31.140 align:middle line:84%
I wish I had, which
was to take more intro

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.380 align:middle line:84%
classes in different
subjects, and to explore

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.440 align:middle line:84%
different potential
career pathways.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.660 align:middle line:84%
I came into college as an
environmental studies major,

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.790 align:middle line:90%
and it worked out well for me.

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:48.600 align:middle line:84%
It worked out great for
me, and I loved what I did.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.090 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't even consider
that there were other things

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.380 align:middle line:84%
out there, and I wish I would
have taken intro to psychology,

00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:00.460 align:middle line:84%
and some sort of intro to law,
or some more science classes.

00:01:04.209 --> 00:01:06.278 align:middle line:84%
But for taking
those intro classes,

00:01:06.278 --> 00:01:08.320 align:middle line:84%
how do you know if that's
something that's really

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.670 align:middle line:90%
going to spark your interest?

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:12.370 align:middle line:84%
So I would really
recommend using

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:16.270 align:middle line:84%
those four years to explore
different career pathways.

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:17.980 align:middle line:84%
Because again, it's
not going to be

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:19.823 align:middle line:84%
a waste if you take an
intro to psych class

00:01:19.823 --> 00:01:20.740 align:middle line:90%
and you don't like it.

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:25.840 align:middle line:84%
You are still going to get
valuable tools and skills

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.570 align:middle line:90%
from that, undoubtedly.

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:37.460 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if I've
mentioned this before,

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:42.790 align:middle line:84%
but I remember when I was
in college studying science,

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:46.570 align:middle line:84%
but we were required
to also take

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:50.950 align:middle line:84%
certain classes like
the counseling, that

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:52.960 align:middle line:90%
is, introduction to counseling.

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.850 align:middle line:84%
And then I was told to study
educational psychology,

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:59.740 align:middle line:90%
and then philosophy.

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.590 align:middle line:90%
We also had to take that.

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.710 align:middle line:84%
In fact, those days, us as
science students had questions

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:08.139 align:middle line:84%
like, what do I
need philosophy for?

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:10.479 align:middle line:90%
What do I need counseling for?

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:13.930 align:middle line:90%
That's not what I'm going to do.

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:19.030 align:middle line:84%
But now, looking back, even
though I thought they were not

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.160 align:middle line:84%
helpful, looking
back-- in fact, I

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.480 align:middle line:84%
will say that I'm
actually relying heavily

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.750 align:middle line:84%
on some of these classes that
I thought were not useful.

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.430 align:middle line:84%
One major regret
that I had was, when

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.090 align:middle line:84%
I was in high school my music
teacher had always said,

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:52.230 align:middle line:84%
Solomon, you had a very
excellent music integration.

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:53.910 align:middle line:90%
We used to laugh at each other.

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:57.750 align:middle line:84%
People would laugh at me
because I was studying music,

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.270 align:middle line:90%
and so I stopped.

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:03.090 align:middle line:90%
And I regret up to now.

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:09.460 align:middle line:84%
Because if I had done it,
even as part of my business,

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:13.810 align:middle line:84%
I would have used it a lot in
my current counseling practice.

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:18.250 align:middle line:84%
But if I had done it, even
when I came to America,

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:23.680 align:middle line:84%
it would have been easier for
me because the church I went to,

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.250 align:middle line:84%
they needed someone to
play the keyboard for them.

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:30.800 align:middle line:84%
And I was so good at it,
I just loved everything.

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:34.870 align:middle line:84%
So as a young student
in the colleges,

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:43.070 align:middle line:84%
I will encourage all of them, I
would just encourage them that,

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:45.070 align:middle line:90%
give yourself that opportunity.

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:46.330 align:middle line:90%
Be open.

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:49.960 align:middle line:84%
As I said earlier, be
fluid in you're learning,

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:53.740 align:middle line:84%
and then study other
areas that you might think

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:55.280 align:middle line:90%
that you have no interest.

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:59.290 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of the day, it
would be very useful to you.

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:01.495 align:middle line:84%
That is one thing
I will recommend

00:04:01.495 --> 00:04:05.410 align:middle line:84%
or I would suggest
to college students.

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:17.670 align:middle line:84%
Explore everything, do
everything, try everything.

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:20.010 align:middle line:84%
Even if you're scared to
try it, try it anyways.

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:22.260 align:middle line:84%
Even if you don't think
you're going to be good at it,

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:23.640 align:middle line:90%
do it anyways.

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:27.570 align:middle line:84%
Even if you think it's probably
going to not be so fun,

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:29.460 align:middle line:90%
give it a shot anyways.

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:31.200 align:middle line:84%
You're not losing
anything, you're not

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:40.120 align:middle line:84%
missing out on anything,
you're just giving things a try

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:44.320 align:middle line:84%
Why do you think that giving
it a try is important?

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:46.090 align:middle line:84%
Because if you don't
try, you'll never

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:47.890 align:middle line:90%
know what could have been.

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:53.093 align:middle line:90%
You just have to try.

00:04:53.093 --> 00:04:54.010 align:middle line:90%
That's the first step.

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:55.885 align:middle line:84%
That's literally the
first step, is to try.

00:05:01.038 --> 00:05:02.455 align:middle line:84%
Without trying,
there's no motion.

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:13.800 align:middle line:90%
I think a career is a quest.

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:15.400 align:middle line:90%
I think life is a quest.

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:17.400 align:middle line:84%
And a career ends up being
a very important part

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:18.960 align:middle line:84%
of how you spend
your time and energy

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:20.460 align:middle line:84%
and what you
contribute to the world

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:21.900 align:middle line:84%
and what you gain
from the world.

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:23.532 align:middle line:84%
I do think, though,
that there are so

00:05:23.532 --> 00:05:24.990 align:middle line:84%
many different
things you could do,

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:26.910 align:middle line:84%
so you should
never feel that you

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:32.082 align:middle line:84%
have one chance to get that
gold goblet or whatever it is.

00:05:32.082 --> 00:05:33.540 align:middle line:84%
As if the end of
the quest, the pot

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:34.810 align:middle line:84%
of gold at the end
of the rainbow.

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:35.910 align:middle line:84%
There are a lot of
rainbows and a lot

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:37.200 align:middle line:90%
of directions you could go.

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:40.890 align:middle line:84%
But since time is limited,
certain point once you've

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:42.985 align:middle line:84%
looked around a
bit and explored,

00:05:42.985 --> 00:05:45.360 align:middle line:84%
you want to start thinking
one step in front of the other

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:47.790 align:middle line:84%
and leading yourself
towards somewhere.

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:51.420 align:middle line:84%
And I would just say,
never feel limited,

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:55.410 align:middle line:84%
always look for clues that
show you what you enjoy.

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:56.650 align:middle line:90%
Build relationships.

00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:01.200 align:middle line:84%
Make sure that you're listening
to people as well as speaking.

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:03.540 align:middle line:84%
And ask lots of
questions, people

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:04.993 align:middle line:90%
love being asked questions.

00:06:04.993 --> 00:06:07.410 align:middle line:84%
Makes them feel special like
they actually know something.

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:10.905 align:middle line:84%
So never hesitate to reach out
to someone even if it seems

00:06:10.905 --> 00:06:12.780 align:middle line:84%
like a long shot just
to come to their office

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:17.130 align:middle line:84%
and talk to them even if
there's not a job available.

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:22.710 align:middle line:84%
And just be a person
who is excited to be

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:23.460 align:middle line:90%
part of something.

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:24.918 align:middle line:84%
Who's excited to
be part of a team,

00:06:24.918 --> 00:06:26.890 align:middle line:90%
who's curious about everything.

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:29.010 align:middle line:84%
And I think if you
approach life that way,

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:31.460 align:middle line:84%
you'll find what
you're looking for.
