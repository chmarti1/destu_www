1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:21,720


2
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:26,550
I think the only thing that
helped me make difficult

3
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:31,440
decisions was continuing to
be put in difficult situations

4
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:37,170
It's realizing, OK, I really
don't like my life right now,

5
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:39,870
I'm really unhappy.

6
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:41,970
No one is going to
change it for me but me.

7
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:44,040
So I need to either get
up and do something,

8
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:46,420
or I'm going to stay like
this for the rest of my life.

9
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:50,048
And it's doing that
time and time again,

10
00:00:50,048 --> 00:00:51,840
that's the only thing
that makes it easier.

11
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,420
It's just, you've got
to keep getting up.

12
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:57,896
You can't just stay miserable.

13
00:00:57,896 --> 00:01:05,680


14
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,250
After my first semester
stage managing,

15
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:11,590
I did realize that it was
a thing that I enjoyed

16
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:14,080
and that I really did--

17
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:19,300
I did like being in
charge or the person that

18
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:22,300
organizes everything and
make sure that things happen.

19
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:26,770
And I like being
in control, so it

20
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:31,250
was a very fitting role
for me, because I like

21
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:33,380
to think I'm fairly good at it.

22
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:34,695
So it just worked.

23
00:01:34,695 --> 00:01:36,320
It was just like,
I'm already organized

24
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,550
and I'm already
on top of things.

25
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:42,250
So it just came naturally.

26
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:44,530
It really didn't take
any effort for me

27
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:45,820
to become a stage manager.

28
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:49,180
It was just like all natural
traits that I already had,

29
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:51,040
and they just flourished.

30
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:55,030
And that's when I realized,
Oh, hey, I have these traits.

31
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:57,600
Yeah, I thought I did, but
like no, you actually do,

32
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,600
because you're doing it.

33
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,767
And now people are telling
you you're doing it well.

34
00:02:00,767 --> 00:02:02,920
So you actually do
have the traits.

35
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:03,970
You're using them well.

36
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:08,350
So that was when I realized--

37
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:10,630
I think that was
actually a really big

38
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:13,900
self-identifying
point in my life too.

39
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:20,130
Because it did make me realize,
you're capable of a lot.

40
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:23,880
If you can take a semester's
worth of engineering classes

41
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:28,080
and also keep track of
college student actors,

42
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,810
Yeah, I think you're
doing all right.

43
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:40,140


44
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:43,910
Even though difficult
things happen,

45
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:49,680
and things get uncomfortable,
and you're not sure what to do.

46
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,680
When you become uncertain,
or you become scared,

47
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:56,650
or you become just a mess
maybe, in some cases.

48
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:59,200


49
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,972
It's just a matter
of doing it anyways.

50
00:03:01,972 --> 00:03:03,430
It doesn't matter
if you're scared,

51
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:07,210
it doesn't matter if you have
doubts, you have to just do it.

52
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:08,200
Go for it.

53
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:11,290
Because if you don't,
then you'll never know.

54
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:15,980


55
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:19,280
You can't let fear stop you.

56
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,540
Every day, fear has the
opportunity to stop you,

57
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:24,920
but you just have to keep going.

58
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,290
You have to do things scared.

59
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:29,330
Doesn't matter if you're
scared or not, just do it.

60
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:29,990
Just do it.

61
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:38,250


62
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:40,350
Well, I think for those
of us, many of us who

63
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:43,027
have lost years in our 20s,
they can be a little scary

64
00:03:43,027 --> 00:03:43,860
while we're in them.

65
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:47,140
But then we look back later
and we're so grateful for them.

66
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:48,840
And I think one
thing that's valuable

67
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,270
is to think of what made
them orienting years?

68
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:53,010
As you said, what
made them years

69
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:55,803
where we actually learn
something about ourselves

70
00:03:55,803 --> 00:03:56,970
and got on to a better path?

71
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:58,470
Because I certainly
have friends who

72
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:01,260
maybe did that for a little
too long and then got

73
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:03,120
into their late
30s and early 40s

74
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:08,310
and still hadn't caught the
train they're waiting for.

75
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:12,210
| think one thing is
limiting those years.

76
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:14,095
So if you spend a
year doing something,

77
00:04:14,095 --> 00:04:16,470
and you've gained something
but it's not really the track

78
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:17,762
you want to be on, that's fine.

79
00:04:17,762 --> 00:04:20,579
But you don't want to make
it 5 or 10 years of that.

80
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:23,820
So that's one
principle I would say.

81
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:27,720
Another principle is,
once it's been six months

82
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,430
or you're stopping
and I'm thinking, OK,

83
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:30,360
what have I gained from this?

84
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,610
What have I learned from this?

85
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:35,080
And if I don't want to
continue in this direction,

86
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:39,180
how can I build on those skills
and those things that I enjoy?

87
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:41,490
For me, for example, I
taught school for a year.

88
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:44,010
And I didn't want to be a
school teacher in the end,

89
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:48,600
but I really enjoyed helping
the students edit their papers

90
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,280
and come up with ideas.

91
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:53,308
And they realized that I
wanted to be an editor, got me

92
00:04:53,308 --> 00:04:54,600
that much closer to what I did.

93
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,767
Ultimately, end up doing it.

94
00:04:55,767 --> 00:04:58,120
And working with people
it was really delightful.

95
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:01,478
So I think that's
really valuable.

96
00:05:01,478 --> 00:05:04,020
I think it's just like, I don't
know a lot about agriculture,

97
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:07,050
but my understanding
is that it helps

98
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:09,660
to let the fields go
fallow every so often,

99
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:12,210
or to plant different crops
to rotate crops through.

100
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:13,710
And I think it's
the same with life.

101
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:16,085
I think even when you've been
in your career for a while,

102
00:05:16,085 --> 00:05:17,890
it helps to bring in
some fresh energy.

103
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:20,497
So if you can really
harvest that in those years.

104
00:05:20,497 --> 00:05:22,080
Say, you spend a
year and go to Europe

105
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:22,860
and do something different.

106
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:24,420
If you're harvesting
fresh energy

107
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:26,160
that you can then
bring back, that

108
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,840
makes that not
actually a lost year.

109
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,850
It makes it a found year.

110
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:32,040
And much more fruitful
than if you just

111
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,697
kept your nose to the grindstone
and stayed in the same line

112
00:05:34,697 --> 00:05:35,280
you'd been in.

113
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:43,160


114
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:45,770
So my undergraduate
education really

115
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:48,405
did focus on all
different disciplines.

116
00:05:48,405 --> 00:05:50,030
The first year program
really made sure

117
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:52,760
that students had a handle
on the basics of art,

118
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,830
and electronic
engineering, and physics.

119
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:58,322
And for me, that really
helped me think broadly.

120
00:05:58,322 --> 00:05:59,780
I'm a journalist
and I'm an editor,

121
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:02,030
so actually in a
very literal sense,

122
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:04,140
these are all areas
I touch on here

123
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:06,470
and there throughout my work.

124
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:09,333
But I think even in
more narrow fields,

125
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:11,750
you think about great thinkers
like Einstein, for example,

126
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:12,980
and how he played the violin.

127
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:15,020
Or you hear stories
about Nikola Tesla,

128
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:17,900
and I remember hearing in my
electronic engineering class

129
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:20,708
that he was on a walk reciting
poetry when he suddenly

130
00:06:20,708 --> 00:06:22,250
had a vision for
something that would

131
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:24,740
become his main breakthrough
for engineering.

132
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:29,120
And I think, when you get too
stuck in one rut of thinking,

133
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,892
you don't have those creative
outside the box ideas.

134
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:33,350
And so I think
general education is

135
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:35,017
really important for
teaching your brain

136
00:06:35,017 --> 00:06:38,000
to function in all different
ways that can wake you up

137
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,390
when you least expect it.

138
00:06:40,390 --> 00:07:38,000
